# Ory Hydra Maester

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ 

> Ory Hydra Maester is developed by the Ory community and is not actively maintained by Ory core maintainers due to lack of resources, time, and knolwedge. As such please be aware that there might be issues with the system. If you have ideas for better testing and development principles please open an issue or PR!

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️

This project contains a Kubernetes controller that uses Custom Resources (CR) to manage Hydra Oauth2 clients. ORY Hydra Maester watches for instances of `oauth2clients.hydra.ory.sh/v1alpha1` CR and creates, updates, or deletes corresponding OAuth2 clients by communicating with ORY Hydra's API.

Visit Hydra-maester's [chart documentation](https://github.com/ory/k8s/blob/master/docs/helm/hydra-maester.md) and view [sample OAuth2 client resources](config/samples) to learn more about the `oauth2clients.hydra.ory.sh/v1alpha1` CR. 

The project is based on [Kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder).

## Prerequisites

- recent version of Go language with support for modules (e.g: 1.12.6)
- make
- kubectl
- kustomize
- [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) for running tests
- [ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) for local integration testing
- access to K8s environment: minikube or a remote K8s cluster
- [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) to generate mocks for testing purposes

## Design

Take a look at [Design Readme](./docs/README.md).

## How to use it

- `make test` to run tests
- `make test-integration` to run integration tests
- `make install` to generate CRD file from go sources and install it on the cluster
- `export HYDRA_URL={HYDRA_SERVICE_URL} && make run` to run the controller

To deploy the controller, edit the value of the ```--hydra-url``` argument in the [manager.yaml](config/manager/manager.yaml) file and run ```make deploy```.

### Command-line flags

| Name                       | Required | Description                            | Default value | Example values                                       |
|----------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **hydra-url**              | yes      | ORY Hydra's service address            | -             | ` ory-hydra-admin.ory.svc.cluster.local`             |
| **hydra-port**             | no       | ORY Hydra's service port               | `4445`        | `4445`                                               |
| **tls-trust-store**        | no       | TLS cert path for hydra client         | `""`             | `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`                 |
| **insecure-skip-verify**   | no       | Skip http client insecure verification | `false`       | `true` or `false`                                       |
| **namespace** | no | Namespace in which the controller should operate. Setting this will make the controller ignore other namespaces. | `""` | `"my-namespace"` |
| **leader-elector-namespace** | no | Leader elector namespace where controller should be set. | `""` | `"my-namespace"` |

## Development

### Testing

Use mockery to generate mock types that implement existing interfaces. To generate a mock type for an interface, navigate to the directory containing that interface and run this command:
```
mockery -name={INTERFACE_NAME}
```
